        This project has many dependencies, and we never want
        to have the actions package blocked by something trivial
        like a major CLI bump.

      hash: 9cd2160659c407a1a8c8ec7250aa28a2b06875fa
      body: |
        This allows the runner to be properly ephemeral without
        having to create special mounts or chroot enviroments.

        When provided with an engine socket, the entrypoint will
        clone itself into another container that is destroyed on exit.

        When the main container service restarts the process repeats
        itself.

    - subject: Use chroot and overlayfs for container runtime filesystem
      hash: 73da5819999d010918628d035e369afac0cdf393
      body: |
        The main goal of this init script is to set up the filesystem
        in a way that changes are not persisted across container restarts.

        Using overlayfs allows faster startup as we don't have to copy
        the root filesystem on every boot, but we can still isolate
        any runtime filesystem changes in a separate layer.

      body: |
        The register script is shared by the VM runtime
        but both runtimes have different label requirements.

        With this change each runtime can set ACTIONS_RUNNER_RUNTIME_LABELS
        during init with whatever functions are appropriate.

      hash: 58f4cb20aaf74d3512e6c2e2184797e176eca823
      body: |
        Golang and pongo templates are simply not the best
        way to generate complex JSON from templates. Also the documentaion
        for both is lacking and a simple node script can do the job.

        If we find a need for templated config files for
        other services we can introduce a confd s6 service.

      body: |
        Instead just rely on the output of 'free -g' to avoid
        any weird results when rounding up from smaller sizes.

        This means that often the memory shown on the runner
        tag will be slightly less than the actual allocated,
        but at least it will be consistent.

      body: |
        The goal is to categorize all env vars as either secrets or variables
        before loading them in each service where they are required.

        This allows better control of secrets, like when they are loaded
        and when they are deleted from the filesystem, in a common way that can
        be shared with the VM runner environment.

      body: |
        These mirrors have proven unreliable, and are only really required
        for focal images.

        Instead, we should install tools as part of the workflow.

      body: |
        The docker compose tests in Flowzone will bring
        the runners online with a dynamic tag specific
        to the commit hash.

        The e2e workflow will wait and execute on the
        draft runners when they come online.

        When the e2e job is complete, the runner
        will automatically teardown, completing the
        docker compose test step.

        on the repo and avoid using the token provided by Flowzone.

    - subject: Override CPU info for ARM variants
      hash: 691b79b3144ab061d358a87762968d8f2c1e8d55
      body: |
        The current docker and balenaEngine binaries refer
        to /proc/cpuinfo to determine the ARM variant on startup.

        When using QEMU to emulate ARM on x86, this file reflects the host
        CPU and not the emulated CPU.

        Similarly, when running arm7l runners on arm64 hosts we want to force
        the Docker to detect the target ARM variant from the container.
