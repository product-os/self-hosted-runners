      hash: 176dce6d2923a4cb4ee8a8e1a129e9bc0a3005d2
      body: |
        The docker compose tests in Flowzone will bring
        the runners online with a dynamic tag specific
        to the commit hash.

        The e2e workflow will wait and execute on the
        draft runners when they come online.

        When the e2e job is complete, the runner
        will automatically teardown, completing the
        docker compose test step.

      hash: 691b79b3144ab061d358a87762968d8f2c1e8d55
      body: |
        The current docker and balenaEngine binaries refer
        to /proc/cpuinfo to determine the ARM variant on startup.

        When using QEMU to emulate ARM on x86, this file reflects the host
        CPU and not the emulated CPU.

        Similarly, when running arm7l runners on arm64 hosts we want to force
        the Docker to detect the target ARM variant from the container.
