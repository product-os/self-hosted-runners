    - subject: Move runtime label generation out of register script
      hash: b48e43adb0d8cfb2f85f3c9106618bc43bf885b6
      body: |
        The register script is shared by the VM runtime
        but both runtimes have different label requirements.

        With this change each runtime can set ACTIONS_RUNNER_RUNTIME_LABELS
        during init with whatever functions are appropriate.

      hash: 58f4cb20aaf74d3512e6c2e2184797e176eca823
      body: |
        Golang and pongo templates are simply not the best
        way to generate complex JSON from templates. Also the documentaion
        for both is lacking and a simple node script can do the job.

        If we find a need for templated config files for
        other services we can introduce a confd s6 service.

      body: |
        Instead just rely on the output of 'free -g' to avoid
        any weird results when rounding up from smaller sizes.

        This means that often the memory shown on the runner
        tag will be slightly less than the actual allocated,
        but at least it will be consistent.

      hash: ddcdc1df64e1d28f32eea629960b5957ffef7e5b
      body: |
        This package is almost semver, with this format:
        `<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<build>`

        If loose versioning still does not find a match
        we can add a regex version scheme for this package.

        This is a revert of the previous change, but with
        additional considerations to use 'exec su -' when replacing
        the current process with long-running processes that could be
        inspected at runtime.

        This should be no-op for the container runtime as we delete
        any existing runner config on container init, but it will
        allow the VM runtime to pre-register earlier in startup.

      hash: 5cb875d223e8bd3361474c0644672ef622e0b944
      body: |
        The goal is to categorize all env vars as either secrets or variables
        before loading them in each service where they are required.

        This allows better control of secrets, like when they are loaded
        and when they are deleted from the filesystem, in a common way that can
        be shared with the VM runner environment.

      hash: 176dce6d2923a4cb4ee8a8e1a129e9bc0a3005d2
      body: |
        The docker compose tests in Flowzone will bring
        the runners online with a dynamic tag specific
        to the commit hash.

        The e2e workflow will wait and execute on the
        draft runners when they come online.

        When the e2e job is complete, the runner
        will automatically teardown, completing the
        docker compose test step.

        on the repo and avoid using the token provided by Flowzone.

      hash: 691b79b3144ab061d358a87762968d8f2c1e8d55
      body: |
        The current docker and balenaEngine binaries refer
        to /proc/cpuinfo to determine the ARM variant on startup.

        When using QEMU to emulate ARM on x86, this file reflects the host
        CPU and not the emulated CPU.

        Similarly, when running arm7l runners on arm64 hosts we want to force
        the Docker to detect the target ARM variant from the container.
