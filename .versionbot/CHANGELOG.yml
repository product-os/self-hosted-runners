    - subject: Override CPU info for ARM variants
      hash: 691b79b3144ab061d358a87762968d8f2c1e8d55
      body: |
        The current docker and balenaEngine binaries refer
        to /proc/cpuinfo to determine the ARM variant on startup.

        When using QEMU to emulate ARM on x86, this file reflects the host
        CPU and not the emulated CPU.

        Similarly, when running arm7l runners on arm64 hosts we want to force
        the Docker to detect the target ARM variant from the container.
